# Labour-Force-Stability-and-Gender-Participation-A-Comparative-Analysis

This project investigates workforce patterns across Indian states and districts using Census 2011 data. The cleaned dataset and Power BI dashboard highlight how gender, employment type, and population structure influence labor force stability in India.

The analysis focuses on five key insights:

- Workforce participation by gender – comparing male and female work participation rates across states and districts.
- Employment stability – studying the balance between main and marginal workers to understand long-term vs. temporary employment trends.
- High marginal labour districts – identifying regions with a high share of marginal workers, indicating seasonal or unstable employment.
- Population vs. employment comparison – examining how total population relates to active workers to reveal state-level workforce strength.
- State-wise demographic variation – understanding how population structure, workforce size, and gender participation differ across states.

The project uses attributes such as total population, total workers, main and marginal workers, gender-wise workforce counts, and calculated measures like Male WPR, Female WPR, Gender Gap, Main Worker %, and Overall WPR.
All insights are visualized through an interactive Power BI report for intuitive comparison and interpretation.
